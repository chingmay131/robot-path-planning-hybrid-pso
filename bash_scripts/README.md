# Path Planning for Mobile Robot Navigation in Unknown Indoor Environments Using Hybrid Metaheuristic Algorithms
1. Easy folder - containing bash scripts for **Easy level world**
   - **easy_world** - for launching Easy level world in Gazebo
   - **proposed** - for spawning robot, followed by running **PSOFS** algorithm for path planning
   - **proposed_delete** - for deleting and spawning robot again, followed by running PSOFS algorithm for path planning, i.e., restart the robot's navigation using PSOFS algorithm
   - **existing1** - for spawning robot, followed by running **PSOA** algorithm for path planning
   - **existing1_delete** - for restarting the robot's navigation using PSOA algorithm
   - **existing2** - for spawning robot, followed by running **PSOD** algorithm for path planning
   - **existing2_delete** - for restarting the robot's navigation using PSOD algorithm
   - **easy_rviz** - for launching rviz (ROS visualization tool)
